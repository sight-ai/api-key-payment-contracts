A secure and efficient smart contract system for managing API key payments with ERC20 tokens on EVM-compatible blockchains.

## Overview

SightAI API Key Payment Contracts provide a decentralized payment infrastructure for API monetization. The system enables users to deposit ERC20 tokens and authorize withdrawals through cryptographically secure signatures, perfect for pay-per-use API services.

### Key Features

- **üîê Secure Withdrawals**: EIP-712 signature-based authorization ensures only valid withdrawals
- **üí∞ Multi-Token Support**: Accept payments in multiple whitelisted ERC20 tokens
- **üõ°Ô∏è Emergency Controls**: Multi-signature emergency pause mechanism for incident response
- **‚ö° Gas Efficient**: Optimized for minimal gas consumption
- **üîç Fully Auditable**: Comprehensive event logging for all critical operations
- **üß™ Battle-Tested**: Extensive test coverage with 19+ test scenarios

## Installation

### Using Foundry

```bash
forge install sight-ai/api-key-payment-contracts
```

Add to your `remappings.txt`:
```
@sight-ai/contracts/=lib/api-key-payment-contracts/src/
```

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @sight-ai/api-key-payment-contracts
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @sight-ai/api-key-payment-contracts
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```solidity
import "@sight-ai/contracts/APIPayment.sol";

// Deploy with configuration
address[] memory supportedTokens = [USDC, USDT];
address trustedSigner = 0x...; // Backend signer address
address[] memory emergencyAdmins = [admin1, admin2, admin3];

APIPayment payment = new APIPayment(
    supportedTokens,
    trustedSigner,
    emergencyAdmins,
    owner
);
```

### User Deposits

```solidity
// User approves token spending
IERC20(token).approve(address(payment), amount);

// User deposits tokens
payment.deposit(token, amount);
```

### Signature-Based Withdrawals

Backend generates EIP-712 signature:
```javascript
const domain = {
  name: "APIPayment",
  version: "1",
  chainId: chainId,
  verifyingContract: paymentAddress
};

const types = {
  Withdraw: [
    { name: "user", type: "address" },
    { name: "token", type: "address" },
    { name: "amount", type: "uint256" },
    { name: "nonce", type: "uint256" },
    { name: "expireBlock", type: "uint256" }
  ]
};

const signature = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, withdrawData);
```

User withdraws with signature:
```solidity
payment.withdraw(token, amount, nonce, expireBlock, signature);
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) - Solidity development framework
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 16.0.0 (for scripts)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sight-ai/api-key-payment-contracts.git
cd api-key-payment-contracts
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
forge install
```

3. Build contracts:
```bash
forge build
```

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report

# Run with verbose output
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test testWithdrawSuccess

# Run with coverage
forge coverage
```

### Local Deployment

1. Start local blockchain:
```bash
anvil
```

2. Deploy contracts (in new terminal):
```bash
# Set deployer private key from anvil output
export PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80

# Run deployment script
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Code Quality

Format code:
```bash
forge fmt
```

Check formatting:
```bash
forge fmt --check
```

## Architecture

### Contract Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ APIPayment.sol      # Main payment processing contract
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MockERC20.sol       # ERC20 token for testing

test/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ APIPayment.t.sol    # Comprehensive test suite

script/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Deploy.s.sol        # Deployment script
```

### Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection**: State updates before external calls
- **Signature Replay Prevention**: Nonce-based validation
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for admin functions
- **Emergency Pause**: Multi-sig controlled circuit breaker
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking

### Design Decisions

1. **Non-Upgradeable**: Intentionally immutable for security and trust
2. **EIP-712 Signatures**: Industry standard for structured data signing
3. **Multi-Sig Emergency**: Prevents single point of failure
4. **Token Whitelisting**: Reduces attack surface by limiting accepted tokens
5. **Block-Based Expiry**: Network-agnostic expiration mechanism

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `deposit(address token, uint256 amount)`
Deposits ERC20 tokens into the contract.

#### `withdraw(address token, uint256 amount, uint256 nonce, uint256 expireBlock, bytes signature)`
Withdraws tokens using a valid signature from the trusted signer.

#### `emergencyPause()` / `emergencyUnpause()`
Emergency admin functions requiring majority consensus.

### Admin Functions

#### `setSupportedToken(address token, bool supported)`
Owner-only function to manage supported tokens.

#### `setTrustedSigner(address signer)`
Owner-only function to update the trusted signer.

### View Functions

#### `getBalance(address user, address token)`
Returns user's balance for a specific token.

#### `isTokenSupported(address token)`
Checks if a token is whitelisted.

## Security

### Audits

This project follows security best practices but has not undergone formal third-party auditing. Use at your own risk in production environments.

### Bug Bounty

We welcome security researchers to review our code. Please report vulnerabilities responsibly to contact@sightai.io.

### Known Considerations

- **Trusted Signer**: The backend signer key must be secured with industry best practices
- **Block Timing**: Signature expiration relies on block numbers which vary by network
- **Token Approval**: Standard ERC20 approval risks apply
